INSTALLATION GUIDE

Extract all files into *root* folder of CFS2 or FS2002. The necessary sub-folders will be created automatically.


CFS2 USERS :

1) Note on SOUNDS : CFS2 does not use the normal default Learjet sounds. Either install the Learjet from FS2K or CFS1, or edit this aircraft's sound.cfg (with Notepad) to point at some jet sounds you already have. THE AIRCRAFT WILL NOT APPEAR UNLESS THE SOUNDS ARE CORRECTLY ASSIGNED.

2) Note on CFS2 WEAPONS - Extract the seperate weapons Zipfile into the root folder the same way as you do for the aircraft.

3) Note on 'AFTERBURNER' feature - You must first set the shift-F4 keystroke to work. To this, follow these steps :

'Settings'
'Controller Assignments'
Scroll down to 'Reheat/Afterburner/on/off' and highlight it.
'Change Assignment ...'
You will be asked to enter the keystroke - hold the shift key and press F4.
Click on 'OK'

You can also use this method to add a joystick button to do the same thing.

In the game, just start the engine, go to full throttle and then press shift-F4. The aircraft will get a big speed boost. You will need to press shift-F4 again, otherwise when you land you will not be able to slow beyond 150kts. You will need afterburner to get above Mach 1 at low altitude.
