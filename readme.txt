Original readme from Frank Safranek:
Dassault Mirage IIICJ Textures - 101 Squadron, Israel Defence Force/Air Force
Created by Frank Safranek

About these textures
--------------------
These textures are intended for use with Alpha Simulations' Mirage IIIC.  
They represent Mirage IIICJ, No. 741, as it appeared in early 1973 while 
assigned to No. 101 Squadron ("First Fighting Squadron") of the Hey'l Ha'avir 
(Israel Defence Force/Air Force) at Hatzor Air Base.  Beginning in 1968, 
after the Six Days War of 1967, tactical aircraft were painted in a three 
tone camouflage.  

The well known large orange triangles were not added until during the 
October 1973 war to distinguish the Israeli Mirage from Egyptian and 
Libyan Mirage 5 aircraft.  By then all of the Israeli Mirage IIIC's had 
been re-engined with the Atar 09C engine (as used in the Mirage IIIE and 
5 variants) so painting the large orange triangles on this early engined 
Mirage IIIC would be completely incorrect.


Installation (CFS2/FS2000/FS2002)
---------------------------------
There are two ways to install these textures.  The first is to make an
entirely new aircraft folder for the Mirage and the second is to add 
these as an optional set to the already installed aircraft.  Both require 
about the same amount of work but the second uses less hard drive space.

First method: Install as an entirely new aircraft

A) Make a new folder under \aircraft and name it "ALPHA Mirage IIICJ" 
(or something like that; just so it's different than the original)
B) Copy all of the files and folders from the original Mirage folder to 
the new one
C) Extract the texture files in this zip file to the \texture folder of 
the new aircraft.  Overwrite as necessary.
D) Edit the aircraft.cfg of the new Mirage so that the [fltsim.0] section 
reads as follows: (just the title line is changed to differentiate)

[fltsim.0]
title=ALPHA Mirage IIICJ
sim=Mirage3C
panel=
sound=
texture=
checklists=

E) That's it.  You will now have another Mirage aircraft available when 
you go to Select Aircraft.

Second method: Install as an optional set of markings

A) Make a new folder under the "ALPHA Dassault Mirage IIIC" folder and 
name it "texture.Israeli"
B) Copy all of the files from the original "\texture" folder to the new one
C) Extract the texture files in this zip file to the new "\texture.Israeli" 
folder.  Overwrite as necessary.
D) Edit the aircraft.cfg file of the Mirage IIIC to add a new [fltsim.1] 
section that reads as follows:

[fltsim.1]
title=ALPHA Mirage IIICJ
sim=Mirage3C
panel=
sound=
texture=Israeli
checklists=

We gave it a unique name and pointed to a different texture folder.  If 
you have already added an additional set of textures then the name of the 
new section may be [fltsim.2].  The point is that each section number must 
be unique, must be in numerical order, and no numbers are skipped.

E) That's it.  You will now have another Mirage aircraft available when you 
go to Select Aircraft.

original Mirage IIIC textures and Colin Norwood for making such a great 
looking aircraft to wrap them around.  Thank you both for your patience.
